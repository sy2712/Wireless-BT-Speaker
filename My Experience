This speaker is build for those who are searching for great sound quality speaker's at a cheaper rate as compared to market rate.
Here you can make this vague idea a reality.
The toughest thing i faced during my time building this amazing speaker is to design its body, when the body was finished everything went easily.
roasted 4ic's and 2speakers.

How I made?

First thing and most important was what material your are using for making its body, what kind of design you are giving it. I tried on Autodesk and i
have shared its design in images folder. When i tried to implement that design it became really dificult to cut trough the centre of both modf board and
acryic so i changed the design little bit. It's image and videos is shared in images folder.
I tried to finish the body as soon as possible as i was in too wait to finally test the sound of that IC. Body part was somewhat difficult as cutting 
trough mdf as it left covered in saw dust and sweat. However i did'nt cared much about it as i was already imagining the fully custom-made speaker.
I made some improvements every time took it in my hands. I'm not a professoinal in this so i have to cover my mistakes by converting into some creativity 
most of the time which resulted in little more time but also little more fun.

Finally, the body was completed(not fully left open from top, bottom and centre to make the changes over time.) and i tested the sound whish was way more 
awesome.
Cnnections were easy it didn't took more than 20min. I tried to connect them but then ran into some complications. I tried to attach variac with it to control 
bass, volume, clearity and that was the difficult part as it was disconnecting again and again..
After  some time i made a custom PCB for the variac so that there won't be any loose connecction.
