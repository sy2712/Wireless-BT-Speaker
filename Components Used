1. MDF Board

  Mdf Board was used to make the outer body of the speaker. I choose this board as Mdf Board gives good sound quality as compared to the other wooden boards.
  
2. Acrylic

  Acrylic was used to make the upper body. You can choose any material for the body as per your need. 
  
3. Led's

  I have used multi-color Led Strip for the party time and normal day-light strip for the working hours.
  
4. 15Watt Speaker

  15 Watt Speakers were supported by my ic and also they have pretty  decent bass.
  
5. 12 volt power supply

  12 volt Power supply is used to pass the power to whole speaker. The Speaker's used 12v power along with both the types of lights and the audio receiver needs a 
  5 volt power so, for the audio receiver I have used the MOSFET which converts my 12 volt of power to 5 volt so that my audio receiver doesn't get burned.

6. Super Glue/Fevicol 

  For holding all the mdf board and arcylic with each other, super glue is used.
  
7. Bluetooth all in one audio receiver

  This all in one audio receiver has USB port, Audio cable, Bluetooth mode, FM  mode and SD card slot built in it.
  
8. IC-CA3110

  This ic is used for controlling the sound in the speakers.
  
9. Arduino-Nano

  Arduino Nano is used for making the audio visualiser lights which will have one speaker and will be synced to the lights.
  
10. Led Strip- W8121or W8121b

  This LED strips are used along with Arduino Nano for the Music Visualiser. 
  
11. Ki-Cad
  
  It is used for designing the PCB for the variac dials.
  
12. Carpentary Tools

It's a basic tools for cutting the board and acrylic.

13. 12 to 5 volt MOSFET

  Mosfet for the Arduino Nano and All in one audio receiver as they require low power suplly.
